Hey,

After an intense week of learning from scratch: React, Nodejs (express) and MongoDB, integrating all of them into a working app is finally done :)

With this application, the client can create various forms and upload them to an online database.
A new form can be made in the 'Form Builder Page' tab.
All forms are displayed in the 'Forms List Page' tab.
Users can then fill out these forms,
And view all the information in the 'Form Submissions page' link of each form.



Here's some instructions for running the App:

Enter the app directory,


#To install dependencies for server run:
npm install

#To install dependencies for client run:
npm run client-install

Then, to run the client & server with concurrently run:
npm run dev

Enjoy!


- Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
